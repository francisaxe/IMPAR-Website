<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a survey website called IMPAR.
PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
- An owner role to create and manage surveys.
- A user role for registered users to answer surveys.
- A content highlighting system for featured surveys.
- Comprehensive user profile management.
- Admin-only pages for user and suggestion management.
- Social sharing capabilities.
- The entire website must be in Portuguese.
- The UI should be redesigned to match a series of images provided by the user.
- A public Results page where anyone can see aggregated survey results in percentages.

**User's preferred language**: Portuguese. The user explicitly requested to switch to Portuguese. The next agent MUST continue all communication and UI development in Portuguese.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database. It includes JWT-based user authentication (owner/user roles), full CRUD for surveys, and the ability for users to take surveys. The application has been fully translated into Portuguese. A Results page to publicly display survey statistics has been implemented. The agent has just begun a major UI redesign based on a new set of images provided by the user, having updated the Navbar, Landing Page, and Surveys List page.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent started a complete UI overhaul based on a new set of images provided by the user. It just overwrote , , and  to match the new design.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool. A screenshot of each updated page is needed to visually verify the new design against the user's images.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues. The focus is on completing the in-progress UI redesign task.

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Complete UI Redesign based on new user-provided images. (P0)

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1:
     - Where to resume: The agent has updated , , and . The next step is to continue updating all other frontend pages and components (e.g., , , , , , etc.) to match the new design aesthetic from the images provided in the last user message.
     - What will be achieved with this? The application's user interface will fully match the user's latest design specifications, providing a consistent and polished look and feel.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend. Each updated page should be verified with the screenshot tool.
     - Blocked on something: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
Upcoming Tasks:
- **Implement Content Highlighting System (P1):** A system to feature or highlight specific surveys, as per the original request. The backend has an  flag, but the frontend logic might need refinement based on the new design.
- **Implement Social Sharing (P1):** A  component exists but needs to be fully integrated and tested across the site to ensure it's functional.
- **Comprehensive User Profile Management (P2):** The current profile page is basic. This task involves expanding it with more user details and settings.

Future Tasks:
- Email invitation system to invite users to surveys.
- Advanced filtering and sorting for survey lists.
- A notification system for new survey responses.
- Ability to embed surveys on external websites via iframes.

- No outstanding issues. Previous issues reported by the testing agent (first user role assignment, submit button visibility) were addressed by the agent.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Motor (async MongoDB driver), Pydantic
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

**key DB schema**
- **users**: 
- **surveys**: 
- **responses**: 
- **suggestions**: 

**changes in tech stack**
- None. The stack remains FastAPI, React, and MongoDB.

**All files of reference**
- : Contains all backend logic and API endpoints.
- : Defines all frontend routes.
- : Manages user authentication state.
- All files under : These are the primary files to be updated for the UI redesign task.
- : Also needs updates for the new design.
- : Contains the product requirements and project history.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The agent has been using  on full files for edits instead of . The next agent should use the  tool for modifying existing files to adhere to best practices and avoid unintended regressions.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **MUST communicate in Portuguese.** This is a strict requirement from the user.
- **The primary task is to continue the UI redesign.** Use the latest images provided by the user as the source of truth and update all frontend pages to match.
- **Use  for file edits.** The previous agent incorrectly used . You must use  for modifying existing files.
- **Verify visual changes.** After updating each page or component, use the  to capture the result and ensure it matches the user's design.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1. User sent new images for a complete UI redesign. (In Progress)
2. User stated they would send photos for all pages. (Completed)
3. User requested the creation of a Resultados (Results) page. (Completed)
4. User requested a UI redesign based on a single image. (Completed, but now being superseded by a new design)
5. User requested to switch the project and communication language to Portuguese. (Completed)
The remaining messages relate to the initial app creation and have been addressed.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: No. The application is functional.
- **Mocked**: No.
- **Inconsistent UI**: Yes. The frontend is in a transitional state where some pages have the new design and others have the old one. This must be resolved by completing the redesign task.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- None currently implemented.

**Testing status**
- Testing agent used after significant changes: YES
- Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
- Test files created:
  - 
  - 
- Known regressions: The UI is currently inconsistent due to the in-progress redesign.

**Credentials to test flow:**
Register a new user through the UI. The first user will be an owner, and subsequent users will have the user role. Example credentials used in testing were  / .

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent repeatedly violated the instruction to use  for editing existing files, opting to  them instead.
- The content highlighting system from the original problem statement has not been fully implemented on the frontend.
- The functionality of the  component has not been fully verified.</analysis>
